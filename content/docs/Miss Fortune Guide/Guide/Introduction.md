## Introduction
I am aCuria, a Miss Fortune Main. I first played Miss Fortune in Season 2, and mained her more seriously after her 2016 rework. Miss Fortune plays and itemizes differently from other ADCs, and I hope this guide will help you enjoy Miss Fortune as much as I do. This guide is intended for players who want learn how to play Miss Fortune better from a mechanics and decision making perspective.

## Why Play Miss Fortune?

### Pros
- One of the easiest ADC to CS with, because the Love Tap Passive means 1.25x - 1.5x damage to minions!
- Miss Fortune is a teamfighting monster, a well placed Bullet Time can win a game on its own
- Multiple playstyles due to huge build and rune diversity
- Late game one shots any squishy in 0.5s with aa q aa
- Destroys towers very quickly
- High +95 movement speed due to strut
- Can build more AD items then other ADCs, while still hitting the 2.5 attack speed cap due to the free attack speed on strut
- Higher potential lifesteal than other ADCs because her Q+W synergizes with lifesteal

### Cons
- Short 550 auto attack range
- Base kit very weak into tanks. She must rely on accurate runes and item builds to circumvent this weakness
- Mana hungry. She cannot spam abilities without some mana regeneration in her build
- No escapes (dash/stun/root)
- Main power (Bullet Time) can be circumvented by certain abilities (wind wall)
- Weak early game 1v1 because if she does not have the items to kill in under 4s, her W times out.

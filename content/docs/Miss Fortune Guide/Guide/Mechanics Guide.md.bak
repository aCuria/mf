## Introduction
I am aCuria, a Miss Fortune Main. I first played Miss Fortune in Season 2, and mained her more seriously after her 2016 rework. Miss Fortune plays and itemizes differently from other ADCs, and I hope this guide will help you enjoy Miss Fortune as much as I do. This guide is intended for players who want learn how to play Miss Fortune better from a mechanics and decision making perspective.

## Why Play Miss Fortune?

### Pros
- One of the easiest ADC to CS with, because the Love Tap Passive means 1.25x - 1.5x damage to minions!
- Miss Fortune is a teamfighting monster, a well placed Bullet Time can win a game on its own
- Multiple playstyles due to huge build and rune diversity
- Late game one shots any squishy in 0.5s with aa q aa
- Destroys towers very quickly
- High +95 movement speed due to strut
- Can build more AD items then other ADCs, while still hitting the 2.5 attack speed cap due to the free attack speed on strut
- Higher potential lifesteal than other ADCs because her Q+W synergizes with lifesteal

### Cons
- Short 550 auto attack range
- Base kit very weak into tanks. She must rely on accurate runes and item builds to circumvent this weakness
- Mana hungry. She cannot spam abilities without some mana regeneration in her build
- No escapes (dash/stun/root)
- Main power (Bullet Time) can be circumvented by certain abilities (wind wall)
- Weak early game 1v1 because if she does not have the items to kill in under 4s, her W times out.


## Combos and Mechanics

### aa > Q > aa & Q2
{{< youtube gqpkLmtHMo4 >}}

This clip shows 2 mechanics, firstly if you execute a minion with Double Up, the Double up bounce will critically strike. If you judge that Q cannot execute the minion (like in this clip) you can aa the minion to bring it into execute range first followed by Q. This combo is almost instantaneous, and needs abit of practice to get the timing right.

AA > Q > AA is the second mechanic shown. It is Miss Fortune's Bread and Butter combo, and is something that many inexperienced players mess up. They cast Q > AA and Miss Fortune loses allot of damage this way. If the Q bounces, The damage loss can be 210% ad + 180 damage (press the attack). Failing to execute this correctly can easily lose you a kill or teamfight.

In the example video, if I did not execute this combo correctly then Akali would have just walked away

### aa + p > Q2 + p > aa > aa > aa ...
{{< youtube MOwAIH70kJw >}}

The idea here is to proc our Love Tap (p) twice while maintaining DPS on a single champion. Sometimes, when there is a convenient minion we can cast Q on the minion (resetting Love Tap) and then landing Q2 with love tap on the enemy champion. 


### Strut & Love Tap Reset Mechanics
{{< youtube DkXxJ8CvOIE >}}
Alternating auto attacks between 2 targets allows you to continuously proc Love Tap (Passive) and also have Strut permanantly activated, as Love Tap reduces the cooldown of strut. This also lets you destroy the nexus turrets very quickly

### Flash > aa > Q > aa
{{< youtube wTB1Q3vC9Js >}}

Used to finish off fleeing enemies, This combo comes out almost instantly. 
- Make sure your Q is off cooldown before flashing, notice I did not flash after lucian, as my Q was on cooldown.
- MF's strongest point is when she has enough items to one-shot champions with AA > Q > QQ

### w > aa > Q  > aa > aa > aa > ...
{{< youtube PYDNo3iZt34 >}}

Miss Fortune's Extended trade combo, it is weak early game, but gets strong after Strut is maxed and Miss Fortune has items like Kraken, Infinity Edge. 
- E can be delayed until after any existing Crowd Control spells end.

### E > R
{{< youtube wTB1Q3vC9Js >}}

E slows enemies, so you can land more ticks of R
- Make sure you have enough (180) Mana to cast E + R! Otherwise just cast R.

### Flash -> E -> R
Often used in teamfights when their front line has engaged on you. Flash backwards to get away, and use R to melt down the enemy team

### Stutter Stepping
{{< youtube oCHC4Xsfg8Q >}}
Stutter stepping is moving in between auto attacks, while still auto attacking at full speed. Is quite easy to execute early game, but is harder to pull off without losing dps as you attack speed increases.

There are several ways to pull this off. 
- The way I do it is to Attack move towards or on top of the enemy (a-click) then click to move away after the auto attack windup time is over. 
- The second way is to re-bind the "A" key to attack nearest enemy, then click away and press the "A" key. This second way is easier to pull of mechanically, because you dont have to move the mouse at all... Until the part where you have to cast a second Q. This is because you have to mentally switch from continuously
clicking away to casting the Q and then switching back.


### Securing Assists

{{< youtube qwBl_4BeAJ0 >}}

Getting assists is just free gold, and is sometimes needed to stack runes like eyeball collector. Make It Rain (E) is a perfect skill for getting free assists, and sometimes you can even use it to execute enemies with Collector!

### 2v2 Teamfighting
In a 2v2 fight, you should attempt to do the following:

1) Use E to slow
2) Land the aa > q > aa combo
3) Use R when they are out of aa range.

A common mistake is to use R straight away, this is not always the correct response if you can get into AA range fast enough. Miss Fortune has huge burst on her AA Q AA combo, without crit it is worth 300% ad + 100 + PTA + Kraken, and possibly 400% if Q bounces. PTA also increases your ultimate damage.

{{< youtube sxsIpobt2kw >}}
Notice we were losing badly in the above clip, having fed 7 kills. In spite of this we could pick up the double kill

{{< youtube 0LNkyP3snOQ >}}
In this clip I was fed enough to one-shot Jhin with aa > q > aa
